**Overview**<br />
<br />
<br />
-All K's seemed to have relatively high accuracy. I believe that is due to the simplicity to classify.<br />
-There is a dip on k=6, I think this is due to the random variations in the training and testing sets.<br />
-Overall the KNN model is correctly classifying Iris species.<br />
-High accuracy could be due to class separation as well.<br />
