**Overview**


-All K's seemed to have relatively high accuracy. I believe that is due to the simplicity to classify.
-There is a dip on k=6, I think this is due to the random variations in the training and testing sets.
-Overall the KNN model is correctly classifying Iris species.
-High accuracy could be due to class separation as well.
